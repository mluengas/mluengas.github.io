The main objective of investing money is to survive.

The investor that catches my attention is the one who, even through market corrections and bear markets, is still in the game.

Those investors are few and unattainable for ordinary people. The one that attracts me the most is Ray Dalio. Because of his tendency to look at everything from a very high, strategic and mechanistic perspective.

My dream is to form a community of people who replicate the decision making resources that Ray Dalio has.

We'll see...

PS: if you are reading this, Ray, and you want to avoid that something similar to what you do is available as "open source", today (JAN 2022) I would stop doing it for USD1M. Later it will be more expensive. Let me know, my DMs are open.
